Remove all files off the pico, probably just main.py at it seems to be
special and runs itself regardless  what's in thonny or commandline as
a standalone script.

Delete via command line or via thonny.
main.py
ssd1306.py

cp standalone.py (eg dataLineRW2picoFlash) to pico.

Select standalone.py from the file view on the pico:
import standalone - to run the script

Note a double import doesn't work  till you get the micropython prompt
back with  a soft  reboot, ie  Ctrl-D, in  thonny or  the commandline.

Alternative to the soft reboot, as per chatGPT:

>>> import sys
>>> # remove from sys.modules if present
>>> if 'dataLineRW2picoFlash' in sys.modules:
...     del sys.modules['dataLineRW2picoFlash']
...
>>> # also remove the name from globals if present
>>> try:
...     del dataLineRW2picoFlash
... except NameError:
...     pass
>>> # now import again (this will execute the file)
>>> import dataLineRW2picoFlash


In short:

import sys
del sys.modules['dataLineRW2picoFlash']
del dataLineRW2picoFlash
import dataLineRW2PicoFlash

Best practice: put runnable code in a function.

Modify your script so top-level code is inside a function, then import
once and call the function repeatedly:

import dataLineRW2picoFlash
dataLineRW2picoFlash.run() # run as many times as you want
