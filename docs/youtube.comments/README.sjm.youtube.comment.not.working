To install the ssd1306 driver for the OLED I had to copy into my working directory the ssd1306.py driver file from the git repository.  Then in Thonny File->Save As sdd1306.py, select 'Raspberry Pi Pico' (not 'My Computer').  The github repository is https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/drivers/display/ssd1306/ssd1306.py.

chatGPT suggested this: - still didn't work 
I got the OLED working by saving the ssd1306.py driver file directly to the Pico using Thonny. Just used File > Save As and made sure to pick the Pico as the destination.

Messaged Paul about it but got no responce.
