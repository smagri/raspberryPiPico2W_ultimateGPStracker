Just a  followup and potential fix.  Not sure if this  is your problem
but I was having a lot of  problems with my code starting up too, with
globals  not  being set  in  time  as  the  thread forked  earlier  in
micropython.   This is  a  known issue  with  micropython.  See  Issue
#10621 and  issue #12698.   One workaround suggested  was to  put your
main() code  into a function.   I have done  this and had  no problems
since.  Go to  the micropython section of the  micropython github page
and read up on these issues if you like. You may be interested in this
too @paulmcwhorter.

ACCEPTED by youtube, I think it doesn't like the word github:
