Yes, there have been reported issues with saving programs to main.py on the Raspberry Pi Pico, particularly when using MicroPython and the Thonny IDE. These problems often stem from the Pico's behavior when a main.py file is present, as it automatically runs on boot, which can interfere with saving new files or accessing the device. You can try by clicking the stop button to stop the program, and then try to save main.py

 @paulmcwhorter  Yes this is when it happens when there is a main.py already on the pico.  Stop in thonny did not work.


 Yes I intend to use the breadboard sized PCB's from ElectroCookie but yes I have done dedicated PCBs for projects using kicad.
