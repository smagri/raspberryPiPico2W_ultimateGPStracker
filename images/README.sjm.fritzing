As  per chatGPT  suggestions.  Used  inkscape  to create  a .svg  from
paul's .jpg file.  But this just treats the whole image as one entity.
That is  you can't  access individual  components in  fritzing.  Also,
fritzing doesn't use .svg files it requires .ffz files.

You would need to ask paul for his original fritzing file, that is the
.fzz file, to start learning about modifying or creating .ffz fritzing
files.

.svg is a  vector graphics file containing information on  how to deal
with images  and still  be able to  zoom in and  out with  the desired
effect. However, every time you zoom the .svg file has to be converted
for a bitmap on the screen.  It has to do this foreach rerender of the
file when you zoom.
